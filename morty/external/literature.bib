abstract = {The time evolution of dipolar-dephasing NMR signals reveals the strength of dipolar couplings in solids. In most instances where microcrystalline samples are investigated, numerical simulations of dipolar-dephasing intensities provide fits to experimental data in order to determine internuclear distances. In this paper, analytic solutions are derived for the time evolution of signals in heteronuclear SEDOR, REDOR, and TEDOR experiments. These solutions, in terms of infinite series of Bessel functions of the first kind, are exact and replace a numerical integration over the possible orientations of the internuclear vectors in a powdered or amorphous sample. Results from the analytic solutions converge rapidly and are compared here with results from numerical integration. A method for efficient least-squares fitting of dipolar-dephasing data is also demonstrated, including fits to experimental SEDOR and TEDOR dephasing curves.},

abstract = {A new procedure for the site-selective measurement of heteronuclear magnetic dipole?dipole interactions involving quadrupolar nuclei has been developed. Particular attention is given to the case of S\{I\} rotational echo double resonance (REDOR) with S = 1/2 and I = 3/2, where the nuclear electric quadrupole splitting affects the efficiency of the $\pi$(I) pulses in recoupling the S?I dipolar interactions. Detailed two- and three-spin simulations using the SIMPSON code indicate that the REDOR response is sensitively affected by the quotient of the nutation frequency and the nuclear electric quadrupole frequency (?1/?q). Multispin systems can be conveniently analyzed using a curvature determination of REDOR data in the limit of short dipolar evolution times (?S/S0 < 0.2), to yield dipolar second moment (M2) values. The apparent M2 values measured in this fashion include a scaling factor f1, the magnitude of which can be predicted if ?1/?q is known. Based on this finding, a robust method has been developed to analyze experimental REDOR data in multispin systems, in terms of average dipolar M2 values, which are shown to be affected by distributions of magnetic dipolar and nuclear electric quadrupolar coupling constants only to a minor extent. Validation experiments on suitable model compounds indicate that dipolar M2 values can be measured within 10\% accuracy in this fashion for crystalline compounds. For glasses, the error may be higher, because of possible cumulative errors that may occur from unknown geometries and distribution effects. Experiments conducted on glassy sodium phosphates indicate that the 31P?23Na dipolar interaction strengths in these systems are differentiable for the various Q(n) sites and increase as the charge of the phosphate moiety increases.

abstract = {A quantitative NMR strategy is developed for the study of the network connectivity (intermediate range structure) and the cation distribution in the sodium aluminoborate glass system. The strategy is based on the analysis of rotational echo double resonance (REDOR) spectroscopy applied to the glasses and the crystalline model compounds Li6Al2(BO3)4, NaBO2, and Na2B4O7. The heterodipolar multispin interaction between the quadrupolar spin systems 27Al ? 11B and 23Na ? 11B is analyzed in terms of approximate second moments, which are extracted from REDOR data measured at short dipolar evolution times. On the basis of 27Al\{11B\} and 11B\{27Al\}-REDOR results, the framework connectivity distribution is extracted and compared to statistical and preferential bonding distribution scenarios, respectively. The sodium aluminoborate system is characterized by a large degree of bonding regularity in the framework. Four-coordinated aluminum is preferentially linked to BO3/2 and BO2/2O- units and vice versa, while linking between two four-coordinate units is disfavored, as expected on the basis of bond valence considerations. In glasses with low aluminum contents and/or high sodium contents, there is a greater tendency toward a randomization of connectivities. Spatial correlations between the sodium nuclei and the boron atoms in the network are probed by complementary 23Na\{11B\}- and 11B\{23Na\}-REDOR experiments. The results reveal that both the three- and the four-coordinated boron species interact equally strongly with sodium cations, consistent with an overall homogeneous cation distribution.

@article{PCCP_2009_11_3522_Seyfarth,
abstract = {We present an approach for determining the positions of the hydrogen
atoms in NHx groups of crystalline materials. It is based on a combination
of quantum-chemical DFT calculations and quantitative solid-state
NMR measurements of N-H and H-H distances. The former provide the
alignment of the NHx groups within the crystal structure whereas
the latter de. ne their internal geometry. For the model system melem
(C6N7(NH2)(3)) the N-H and H-H distances were determined to 1.055(7)
angstrom using a Lee-Goldburg CP experiment and to 1.79(2) angstrom
based on homonuclear double-quantum excitation with a R14(2)(6) sequence,
respectively. The thus-obtained positions of the hydrogen atoms were
verified by analysing H-1-C-13 solid-state NMR cross-polarization
build-up curves. The calculated polarization transfer rates depend
on both the hetero- and the homonuclear second moments M-2(HC) and
M-2(HH). Thus this experiment is highly sensitive to the positions
of the hydrogen atoms within a given crystal structure. The agreement
between calculated and experimentally observed transfer rate constants
turned out to be poor if the calculations were based on single crystal
diffraction data only. While the use of quantum chemical relaxed
structure models improve the situation significantly, a satisfactory
agreement could only be reached with the incorporation of the NMR
distances into the optimized structure. Our results prove that the
combination of DFT structure optimizations with quantitative solid-state
NMR experiments is a powerful and very accurate tool for the determination
of the hydrogen substructure for a known structure model of heavy
atoms only. Since the localization of the hydrogen atoms is often
not possible based on X-ray diffraction data, the presented approach
appears to be very promising for future applications.},
